# ðŸ“§ Email / SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a **spam detection model** for classifying emails or SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**.  
It was built as a hands-on machine learning project using **Python**, `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `NLTK`.

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Processes text data (emails/SMS) and converts to numerical features using **TF-IDF**  
âœ… Trained and evaluated multiple models:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** (main chosen model, Based on fscore and recall values).  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

âœ… Visualizes data distribution and model performance  
âœ… Predicts whether a new message is spam or not
